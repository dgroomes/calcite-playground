## Overview

This repository is me learning Apache Calcite by example. I'm interested in its query planning, optimizing and execution capabilities which it offers through a generic API.

I've struggled to really understand the details and API of Calcite by reading the user guide-type docs on the website. So I'm going to "learn by doing" and adapt from the [`csv` example project](https://github.com/apache/calcite/tree/main/example/csv) and tweak that project to learn the concepts and features I'm interested in. I'm particularly interested in how joins work for in-memory datasets. How does that algorithm work? Does it use bit sets?


## Standalone subprojects

This repository illustrates different concepts, patterns and examples via standalone subprojects. Each subproject is
completely independent of the others and do not depend on the root project. This _standalone subproject constraint_
forces the subprojects to be complete and maximizes the reader's chances of successfully running, understanding, and
re-using the code.

The subprojects include:

### `csv/`

A Calcite-based program that uses the official CSV adapter to treat CSV files as tables and make them queryable via SQL.

See the README in [csv/](csv/).


### `linq4j/`

An example program that uses Linq4j (a subproject of Apache Calcite) to join in-memory collections.

See the README in [linq4j/](linq4j/).


### `relational-algebra/`

An example program that uses the Apache Calcite relational algebra API to query over a data set.

See the README in [relational-algebra/](relational-algebra/).


## Notes

Quote from the [Calcite tutorial](https://calcite.apache.org/docs/tutorial.html):

> As a "database without a storage layer‚Äù, Calcite doesn‚Äôt know about any file formats


## Wish List

General clean-ups, TODOs and things I wish to implement for this project:

* [x] DONE Get the CSV example working. Adapt it mostly verbatim from the official example.
* [x] DONE (I think I'm satisfied by finding https://github.com/apache/calcite/blob/e3105a8fe03a08d02500001314dc4e9696285e83/linq4j/src/test/java/com/example/Linq4jExample.java#L25) "Drill to the core". I should be able to drill past the JDBC/Avatica layer and create an "enumerable and/or binding?"
  directly (and via the relational algebra API) and then execute it. I learned that the "bindable" is the thing that
  gets executed and "does the work" of actual query execution. In Calcite, code-generated Linq4J code is how this works
  by default (in the absence of other adapters/engines). This is what I want to do. Probably do this work in the context
  of a simple in-memory/small dataset. Maybe I could do in the `csv/` subproject but that would be conflating two things.
* [x] DONE Create a Linq4j subproject. See https://github.com/apache/calcite/blob/e3105a8fe03a08d02500001314dc4e9696285e83/linq4j/src/test/java/com/example/Linq4jExample.java#L25
* [x] DONE Create a "relational-algebra" subproject that queries over a data set using the Calcite relational
  algebra API directly and *does not* depend on JDBC. It's interesting that the Calcite 'core' module includes JDBC
  because (from my understanding at least) the core of Calcite is the relational algebra API, the optimizer, the default
  execution engine and some other cross-cutting things like the test kit and statistics. JDBC is like an adapter over that
  (albeit the most important and common one).
* [x] DONE (done in the `class-relationships` subproject) (stretch) UPDATE (ok heap dumps are cool but we need to bring in a lot of complexity to deserialize it which I
  don't want to deal with so let's do a schema over classes. e.g. this class has a field that references this other class) Create a subproject that creates a schema over a heap dump. There already is [a Calcite plugin for Eclipse Memory Analyzer](https://github.com/vlsi/mat-calcite-plugin),
  but I want to learn by implementing something myself and heap dumps are a convenient source of in-memory relational data.
* [ ] IN PROGRESS Learn how in-memory joins (the thing that Calcite does for something it calls its "enumerable calling convention") are implemented. I want to learn this in the context of the class-relationships subproject. Can
  I make an optimizer rule?


## Reference

* [Apache Calcite](https://calcite.apache.org/)
* [Apache Calcite: Tracing](https://calcite.apache.org/docs/howto.html#tracing)
   * > To enable tracing, add the following flags to the java command line: `-Dcalcite.debug=true`
* [Apache Calcite: *Built-in SQL implementation*](https://calcite.apache.org/docs/adapter.html#built-in-sql-implementation)
   * > Relational expressions of enumerable convention are implemented as ‚Äúbuilt-ins‚Äù: Calcite generates Java code, compiles it, and executes inside its own JVM. Enumerable convention is less efficient than, say, a distributed engine running over column-oriented data files, but it can implement all core relational operators and all built-in SQL functions and operators.
