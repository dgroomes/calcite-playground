## Overview

This repository is me learning Apache Calcite by example. I'm interested in its query planning, optimizing and execution capabilities which it offers through a generic API.

I've struggled to really understand the details and API of Calcite by reading the user guide-type docs on the website. So I'm going to "learn by doing" and adapt from the [`csv` example project](https://github.com/apache/calcite/tree/main/example/csv) and tweak that project to learn the concepts and features I'm interested in. I'm particularly interested in how joins work for in-memory datasets. How does that algorithm work? Does it use bit sets?


## Standalone subprojects

This repository illustrates different concepts, patterns and examples via standalone subprojects. Each sub-project is
completely independent of the others and do not depend on the root project. This _standalone sub-project constraint_
forces the subprojects to be complete and maximizes the reader's chances of successfully running, understanding, and
re-using the code.

The subprojects include:

### `csv/`

A Calcite-based program that uses the official CSV adapter to treat CSV files as tables and make them queryable via SQL.

See the README in [csv/](csv/).


## Notes

Quote from the [Calcite tutorial](https://calcite.apache.org/docs/tutorial.html):

> As a "database without a storage layer‚Äù, Calcite doesn‚Äôt know about any file formats


## Wish List

General clean-ups, TODOs and things I wish to implement for this project:

* [x] DONE Get the CSV example working. Adapt it mostly verbatim from the official example.
* [ ] Create a subproject that creates a schema over a heap dump. There already is [a Calcite plugin for Eclipse Memory Analyzer](https://github.com/vlsi/mat-calcite-plugin),
  but I want to learn by implementing something myself and heap dumps are a convenient source of in-memory relational data.
* [ ] Learn how in-memory joins are implemented. I want to learn this in the context of the heap dump subproject. Can
  I make an optimizer rule?
